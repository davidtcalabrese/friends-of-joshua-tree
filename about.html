                        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                        <p>Friends of Joshua Tree Park is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting the park and help to develop deeper relationships between nature and the community. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Esse, dignissimos vitae laboriosam eos nulla ea placeat veritatis ipsa numquam unde.</p>
                        <p>You could sit here for weeks with your one hair brush trying to do that - or you could do it with one stroke with an almighty brush. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. We'll play with clouds today. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens.</p>
                    </div> <!--mission-statement-->
                    
                    <div class="history section">
                        <h2>Our History</h2>
                        <img src="static/images/sunset-over-joshua-tree-cropped.png" alt="sunset" class="circle">
                        <p>Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. I like to beat the brush. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.</p>
                        <p>Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things</p>
                        <p>In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Let's have a happy little tree in here.</p>
                    </div> <!--history-->
        
                    <div class="future section">
                        <h2>Our Future</h2>
                        <img src="static/images/nightSky-1-circle.png" alt="starry sky" class="circle">
                        <p>Let's do it again then, what the heck. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. Isn't that fantastic? It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. We'll paint one happy little tree right here.</p>
                        <p>Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. In your world you have total and absolute power. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look.</p>
                        <p>We'll throw some happy little limbs on this tree. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. This is the fun part That easy. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend.
                        Don't fiddle with it all day. Let's do that again. You can get away with a lot. Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted.    
                        </p>

                    <div class="our-work section">
                        <h2>Our Work</h2>
                        <img src="static/images/circle-tree-cropped.png" alt="starry sky" class="circle">
                        <p>Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. This is your world.</p>
                        <p>The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction. See there how easy that is. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. This is truly an almighty mountain. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind.</p>
                        <p>Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Use your imagination, let it go. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day.</p>
                        <p>We need a shadow side and a highlight side. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful.</p>
